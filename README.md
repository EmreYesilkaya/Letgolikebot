# Letgo LÄ°KE BOT (Not finished)
![](https://logodix.com/logo/285634.png)


Dear all,

I have developed a Python code using the pyautogui library that allows users to easily enter their email and password into the Letgo website, select their location and choose the items they want to like using a simple script. This code utilizes the croxyproxy to enable users to enter comma-separated values easily.

It is important to note that this code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any commercial or illegal purposes. Users who choose to use this code are solely responsible for their actions and any consequences that may arise from using this code.

Please use this code responsibly and only for the intended purposes of learning and experimentation. Do not use this code for any commercial or illegal purposes.

Thank you for your understanding and responsible use of this code.
